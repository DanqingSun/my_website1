---

My name is Danqing Sun. I was born and grew up in China. I am enrolled in the Masters of Financial Analysis program in London Business School and I received my undergraduate education in Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. My major in University is also Finance.


As to my interest and hobbies, I have to say I am an animal-lover and I raise a dog and a cat as pets. Zoos have long been my favorite places.





Also, I am a foodie and I really enjoy Chinese and Korean food, especially hot pot.


Besides, I love traveling around in my spare time and I spent four years exploring the Hangzhou where my university is located.  I definitely recommend you a tour to the city.  With the West Lake located in the center of the city, Hangzhou has the most beautiful scenery in the world. 


If you share a similar interest or hobby with or you want to learn more about me, feel free to reach me by my email! I am always open for a chat.
